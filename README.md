## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools

### Extenject (Zenject)

Dependency injection in the project is managed with **Extenject (Zenject)**. This allowed for a modular and flexible code structure, making it easier to test and expand game functionality.

### New Unity Input System

I used the **Unity Input System** to provide improved player control.

### Sound Manager

I created my own Sound Manager to handle scary sounds and game settings.
